### TASK
  - Implement a neural network in C++ without the use of advanced libraries or frameworks.
  - Train it on the supplied Fashion-MNIST dataset using a backpropagation
    algorithm.

### DATASET
Fashion MNIST (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07747.pdf) - a modern version of a
well-known MNIST (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). It is a dataset of
Zalando's article images â€’ consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples
and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image,
associated with a label from 10 classes. The dataset is in CSV format. There
are four data files included:  
 - `fashion_mnist_train_vectors.csv`   - training input vectors
 - `fashion_mnist_test_vectors.csv`    - testing input vectors
 - `fashion_mnist_train_labels.csv`    - training labels
 - `fashion_mnist_test_labels.csv`     - testing labels
